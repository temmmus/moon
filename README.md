# The Moon

This is a simple application that displays a rotating 3D model of the Moon in the browser. The app demonstrates how to integrate Three.js with React for rendering interactive 3D content.

## Features

- 3D Model: Displays a rotating 3D model of the Moon.
- Interactive Scene: Explore the Moon's surface in a web browser.
- Smooth Animation: Uses Three.js to create smooth rotation and rendering.

## Technologies

- **[React](https://react.dev/)**: A JavaScript library for building user interfaces, particularly well-suited for creating interactive and dynamic web applications.
- **[Three.js](https://threejs.org/)**: A JavaScript library that simplifies the creation and rendering of 3D graphics in the browser, enabling the development of complex 3D scenes and animations.
- **[TypeScript](https://www.typescriptlang.org/)**: A superset of JavaScript that adds static types.
- **[HTML](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML)**: Markup language for structuring web pages.
- **[CSS](https://www.w3.org/Style/CSS/)**: Stylesheet language for styling web pages.
- **[Vite](https://vitejs.dev/)**: A build tool and development server that provides fast hot module replacement.
